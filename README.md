# Text Narrator with Polly

## 🌟 Overview

In this project, I developed a text-to-speech narrator using Amazon Polly. Text content is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket, where it is automatically converted into natural-sounding speech. The narrator supports customizable options such as voice selection, pitch, and language, allowing for flexible and dynamic audio output.
